## üõ´ Overview  
This project provides an opportunity to step into the shoes of a British Airways Data Scientist and complete tasks that replicate real-world work accomplished by the British Airways Data Science team. The project consists of two tasks:  

1. **Analyzing customer review data** through web scraping and sentiment analysis.  
2. **Building predictive models** to forecast customer buying behavior.

## üìå Task 1: Web Scraping for Company Insights  
### Objective:  
Scrape and analyze customer review data to uncover key findings for British Airways.  

### Steps:  
- Applied **web scraping** on unstructured third-party customer review data from [Airline Quality](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways).  
- Conducted **Sentiment Analysis** using the **NLTK** library in Python to classify reviews as **positive, neutral, or negative**.  
- Compiled findings and insights into a **PowerPoint presentation**.

## üìå Task 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behavior  
### Objective:  
Build a predictive model to understand the factors influencing customer purchasing decisions.  

### Steps:  
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and applied **feature engineering** techniques.  
- Developed a **classification model** to predict customer buying behavior.  
- Presented key insights and findings through a **PowerPoint report**.
